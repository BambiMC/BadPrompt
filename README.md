# BadPrompt
Code for the paper "BadPrompt: Backdoor Attacks on Continuous Prompts"
## Note: 
We will release all the code after the blind review. Here are part of codes.
This is modified from [DART](https://github.com/zjunlp/DART), which is the source code of the ICLR'2022 Paper

[Differentiable Prompt Makes Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13161.pdf)

We made necessary changes.
